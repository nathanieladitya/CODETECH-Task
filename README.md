Overview of the Project

Project Overview: Inventory Management System
The Inventory Management System is a Python-based program designed to manage the inventory of a store or warehouse. It provides functionalities such as product management, inventory tracking, reporting, and user authentication. The system aims to streamline inventory processes, minimize errors, and improve usability with a graphical user interface (GUI).

Features
1. User Authentication
Secure login system with usernames and passwords.
Role-based access control:
Admin: Full access to all features.
Staff: Limited access (e.g., view inventory, update stock).
2. Product Management
Add Product:
Input product details such as name, ID, category, price, and quantity.
Validate data for completeness and correctness.
Edit Product:
Update product information, such as quantity or price.
Delete Product:
Remove products from the inventory.
3. Inventory Tracking
Real-time inventory updates for incoming and outgoing stock.
Low-stock alerts:
Notify users when stock levels fall below a predefined threshold.
Inventory search:
Filter products by name, category, or ID.
4. Reporting
Low-Stock Report:
List of products with quantities below the threshold.
Sales Summary:
Summarize sales by day, week, or month.
Calculate total revenue and top-selling products.
5. Data Validation
Ensure user inputs are valid:
Mandatory fields for product details.
Price and quantity must be non-negative numbers.
Prevent duplication of product IDs.
6. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
User-friendly interface built with a Python GUI library such as Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy.
Functionalities include:
Navigation menu for different features.
Forms for adding/editing products.
Dashboard displaying inventory statistics and alerts.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
GUI Framework: Tkinter / PyQt / Kivy
Database: SQLite (for local storage) or MySQL (for scalable use cases)
Additional Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
matplotlib for data visualization in reports.
bcrypt or similar for secure password hashing.
System Workflow
Authentication:

User logs into the system.
Access granted based on user role.
Product Management:

Admin/staff adds or updates product details.
System validates and stores data.
Inventory Tracking:

Automatically update stock levels on sales or new stock arrival.
Generate low-stock alerts when necessary.
Reporting:

Admin generates reports for decision-making.
User Interaction:

All interactions are handled via the GUI for better usability.
